### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- vanilla javascript

### What I learned

- leant to use switch case statements more effectively. 
- using grid to make design much more responsive. 
- learnt to custom make small elements in a project

### Continued development

- To save time I hardcoded the pricing values into the code instead of making a function to calculate the price.

### Useful resources

- [styling range slider tool](https://www.cssportal.com/style-input-range/) - used this online tool to style the range slider.
- [toggle switch](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_switch.asp) - used this article to make a toggle switch.
